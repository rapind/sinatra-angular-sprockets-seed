# Sinatra + AngularJS + Sprockets

Application skeleton using Sinatra, AngularJS, and Sprockets.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/rapind/sinatra-angular-sprockets-seed.git shiny-new-app
cd shiny-new-app

rm -rf .git
git init .
git add .
git commit -am "Initial Commit"
Running
Usually you'll want two shells open. One for rack and another for guard. You could alternatively run either or both in the background, but I prefer having them both open while I work.

Shell 1

rackup
Shell 2

guard
